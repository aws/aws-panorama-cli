Compilation job completed. Downloading model artifacts...
Successfully downloaded compiled artifacts (s3://<path>/compiled_models/8fc8b572/resnet18_model-LINUX_ARM64_NVIDIA.tar.gz) to ./assets/b34a8c8eeb7c21cfb93f8715e6acfb4180add00d13b40e4d6488b8fd5e659be8/resnet18.tar.gz
Copy the following in the assets section of package.json of the package where the model is being used
{
    "name": "resnet18",
    "implementations": [
        {
            "type": "model",
            "assetUri": "b34a8c8eeb7c21cfb93f8715e6acfb4180add00d13b40e4d6488b8fd5e659be8",
        }
    ]
}

To use a precompiled Sagemaker Neo mode
```
$ panorama-cli download-model --model-name callable_squeezenet --model-s3-uri s3://<path>/compiled_models/ssd.tar.gz
Copy the following in the assets section of package.json of the package where the model is being used
{
    "name": "callable_squeezenet",
    "implementations": [
        {

            "assetUri": "3b39f4956d4d86c0b7de70486a67106e850b82c5e04a104b4828b6c8ac2965fb.sqfs"
        }
    ]
}
```

Add package specific code into src directory of the package and then use the following command to build a package.
Also add the package entry file path into the descript.json
```
$ sudo panorama-cli build --package-name people_counter --package-path packages/accountXYZ-people_counter-1.0 --entry-file-path packages/accountXYZ-people_counter-1.0/src/<package_entry_file_name>
```


When the applicaiton is ready, use the following command to upload all the packages to the cloud
```
$ panorama-cli package-application
```
